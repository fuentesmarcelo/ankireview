// PREP

// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

function smash (words) {
    return ""
}
//hint: .join() can be solved via arrow

// P: the parameter is words 
// R: we want to return the words smashed together with spaces between each word
// E: n/a
// P: solve using an arrow function
// we will use .join on the parameter of words


// my solution

const smash = words => words.join('');
