//Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
    //You got this!
    
}
// hint: slice() also with arrow function


// my solution

const removeChar = str => str.slice(1, -1);
