// PREP

// Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

// To make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including .toString(), .join(), .split(), parseInt and .Number().

function add(a, b){
    // code here
}


// P: the parameter is (a, b) with one num and the other string
// R: return true if they are the same character(regardless of type)


const add = (a, b) => a==b;
