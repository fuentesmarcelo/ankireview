// The sperm cell determines the sex of an individual in this case. If a sperm cell containing an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote will be XX or female. If the sperm cell contains a Y chromosome, then the resulting zygote will be XY or male.

function chromosomeCheck(sperm) {
    return `Congratulations! You're going to have a ${sperm === 'XY' ? 'son' : 'daughter'}.`
