// PREP
//Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
//[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

function greet(name){
    //code here
}
//hint: back ticks can be solved as an arrow function

// P: the parameter is a name
// R: we want to return a message 
// E: n/a
// P: n/a


// my solution

function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
}
