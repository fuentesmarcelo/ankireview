// ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.
// + , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    // code here
}

// my solution

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    return `${string1} ${string2}`
}
