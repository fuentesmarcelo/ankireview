//To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
//Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
//Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

function openOrSenior(data){
    // ...
}
//hint: .map and arrow 

// my solution

const openOrSenior = [age, handicap] => age < 55 && handicap < 8 ? 'Open' : 'Senior';

// right solution

const openOrSenior = data => data.map(([age, handicap]) => (age > 54 && handicap > 7) ? 'Senior' : 'Open');
